Produces a file that allows you to see different
typeface sizes at distances.


This Python script creates an HTML document in C:\Temp. 

The script takes as an input an installed typeface name, and a font if you like, and creates an HTML file. 
The HTML file will list, row by row, the typeface in sizes from 6 point to 72 point. You are free to add point sizes to the list as you like. 

For example, at the prompt type Arial Bold.  

The resulting HTML file in C:\Temp will be named, in this case, ArialBold.html.
